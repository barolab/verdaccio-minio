## 0.2.0
### Breaking changes

In order to add support for older verdaccio versions I've renamed the plugin to `minio` instead of `minio-storage`. This impact all verdaccio configuration file you may have.
You'll need to replace the `minio-storage` key in the verdaccio config file, so it'll look like this :

```yaml
plugins: /verdaccio/plugins
storage: /verdaccio/storage/data
store:
  minio: # instead of minio-storage
    port: 9000
    region: us-east-1
    endPoint: minio
    accessKey: this-is-not-so-secret
    secretKey: this-is-not-so-secret
    useSSL: false
```
